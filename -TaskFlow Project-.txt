Today, TaskFlow is LIVE! 🎉
🚀 Excited to share my latest project: TaskFlow - Full-Stack Task Management System

I'm thrilled to announce the completion and deployment of TaskFlow, a production-ready web application I built to demonstrate my full-stack development capabilities.

💻 What I Built:
TaskFlow is a comprehensive task management system that allows teams to create, assign, and track tasks with real-time updates and secure user authentication.

🛠️ Tech Stack:
- Frontend: React 18 + Vite, React Router, Axios
- Backend: ASP.NET Core 8 Web API
- Database: Azure SQL Server
- Authentication: JWT + BCrypt
- Deployment: Azure App Service + Vercel
- API Documentation: Swagger/OpenAPI

✨ Key Features:
- Secure user authentication and authorization
- Role-based access control (Admin/User)
- Complete CRUD operations for task management
- Task assignment and real-time status tracking
- Priority-based organization (Low/Medium/High)
- Responsive design for all devices
- RESTful API architecture

🎯 Technical Highlights:
- Implemented JWT-based authentication with BCrypt password hashing
- Designed normalized database schema with proper relationships
- Built 15+ RESTful API endpoints with proper error handling
- Created reusable React components with Context API
- Deployed to Azure cloud infrastructure with CI/CD
- Configured CORS and security best practices

💡 What I Learned:
This project pushed me to master both frontend and backend development, cloud deployment, database design, and production-level security practices.
